## Building the service

This is a Java 8 project and uses Apache Maven to perform the build so you will both installed. Once built using this
project and will produce a zip (appworks-service-example_1.0.0.zip) in the `/target` directory that can be deployed
to an AppWorks Gateway 16.2 instance. All you need to do is run `mvn clean package`.

Please review the pom.xml for the build process, but more importantly the service's code itself for information on
how the AppWorks SDK works and how to build a minimal but functional AppWorks Spring MVC service.
